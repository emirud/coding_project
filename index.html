    <h3>The pains of planning</h3>
    <p>If I had only known, how much trouble this dream was going to be, now I honestly doubt I would have still kept my ambition to go through with it!
  The first steps were taken almost a year in advance, contacting the Embassy and making sure I could intern there throughout the summer, just in case
  anyone else tries to steal my spot and ruin the poorly balancing plan. What did the Embassy say? "Why are you contacting us so far in advance lol,
  come back like three months before the internship is supposed to start." Okay then...
  The next step was going to be making sure I didn't have to live on the street. And lets just say, that wasn't easy either. Apparently finding a room
  to rent in Paris is not only extremely expensive and unsafe, but also so-many-documents-complicated. So I couldn't technically legally rent a room.
  After months and months of fruitless efforts and panic tears I finally came across a nice lady leaving her apartment to go on holiday with her family.
  And so I ended up securing a nice, two bedroom apartment in a safe neighbourhood. In Paris terms, an absolute score!
  But... how to pay the rent when you're a student? Part-time work, of course. And lots of it. After running around a clothing store for 40 hours a week
  for 3 months by the time I had to leave I had saved <em>just about enough</em> money to cover my dreamy two months in the French capital.

    <h3>How it all began</h3>
      <p>The first time I visited Paris was in 2007. I was only 11 years old and to me it was the biggest, most impressive city I had visited to date.
          With over 2 million people living in central Paris (and many more million beyond the periphery), the experience turned my world around. The swarms of people
          roaming around the city, the amount of traffic and noise, tourists in groups occupying sidewalks and their buses cramming tiny side streets. Glad to say nothing
          has changed, really.<br>I realised right away that I wanted to live in this city, to be one of them, a Parisian, with my cute preppy outfits and red heels
          running around Paris from one caf√© to another meeting my amazing artist friends and having a fabulous time. You know, the kind you see in movies, a gorgeous,
          stylish life. It was a little girl's dream, but it turned into a rather serious vision, one that I kept on working for <em>ten years</em> until I could finally
          figure out a way to make it happen. Paris haunted me, it never left my mind, I was obsessed. But that is what allowed me to strive for a Parisian life with
          perseverence.
